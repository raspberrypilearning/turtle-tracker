## Real turtle movements

In this step you will switch to using a map backdrop showing the island of Poilou. Coordinate data for a real turtle that was tracked by the Shuttleworth foundation has already been added to Turtle 3. You will copy your code from Turtle 2 to Turtle 3 to find out the route this turtle took.

Click on the 'grid/map' button to switch to the Poilao Island backdrop. You should see a map of the area around Poilao island off the west coast of Africa. This small island measures less than 1km (1000 metres) across. Poilao is an important environmental location for nesting green sea turtles.

The carapace (shell) of an adult green sea turtle is about 1m long.

Select Turtle 3 and click on the Code tab. Open the Variables section and check the boxes next to the x coord and y coords lists. 

These lists are 'For this sprite only' and contain different data to the lists you created for Turtle 2.

You will be able to see the x and y coordinates. These are based on the real movements of a sea turtle and have been turned into Scratch coordinates that work with the Poilao backdrop. 

When you have seen the coordinates you can uncheck the boxes to hide them.

It's hard for humans to understand lists of numbers. Now you will copy your code to Turtle 3 to draw and stamp the coordinates to make it easier to see where this turtle went.

Select Turtle 2 and click on the Code tab. Drag the `when this sprite clicked` block and all the blocks underneath will also move, keep dragging until you are over the Turtle 3 sprite under the stage. The Turtle 3 sprite will do a little wiggle to show that it has been selected and you can stop dragging. 

The code will still be available on Turtle 2 but there will also be a copy in Turtle 3's Code tab.

Select Turtle 3 and click on its Code tab to see the copied code.
