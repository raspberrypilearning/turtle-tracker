## Importing data from a file

Scratch allows you to import data from a file. This is really useful when you have lots of data that you want to use and it would take too long to type it. 


--- task ---
Select Turtle 4. It has lists that have been created but which don't have any coordinates in them. 

Check the boxes to see Turtle 4's lists  on the Stage. 

--- /task ---


We have prepared some more data based on routes that real turtles have taken around Poiloa. You can download these data files and import them into your project so you can find out where the turtles went. 

--- task ---
Visit [short link] and choose a data file to download. You can choose any of them. 

Save the file on your local computer, a shared network drive or an external drive such as a USB drive. Remember where you saved it and what the file was called. 
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Now go back to Scratch. 

Right click (or tap and hold) on the `Turtle 4: x coords` list and choose import. 

Select the file that you downloaded, it will be something like 'turtle5.csv'. 

When you are asked 'which column should be used?', enter the number 1. The x coordinate data is in the first column of the file.

Scratch will load the data from the first column in the file into the Turtle 4's x coords list.

--- task ---
Now repeat the importing of the data for the y coordinates. 

Right click (or tap and hold) on the `Turtle 4: y coords` list and choose import.

Choose the same file as before. 

This time, choose column **2** which contains the y coordinate data for the same turtle.

--- task ---
Copy the code from Turtle 3 to Turtle 4 by dragging it. Change the colour of the line that gets drawn to 50.

--- task ---
Click the green flag to run your code and find out where this turtle went.

If you have time you can download more data and follow the journeys of more turtles.
