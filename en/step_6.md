## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Used `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} blocks to communicate colour changes and movement between sprites
+ Used the `video`{:class="block3extensions"} extension to detect colours in real-world objects
+ Used the `or`{:class="block3operators"} operator to aid colour identification

If you are following the [Keep it green] pathway of projects, then try out the project [blah].

Another optional exercise is to create origami animals that represent the animals you are counting. You can find many different origami animals to create [here](http://rpf.io/origami){:target="_blank"}.
