## Introduction

In this project you will use the `Pen`{:class="block3extensions"} extension and Scratch x and y coordinates to draw the locations visited by green sea turtles over a few days during their nesting time. It's important to understand the movements of these endangered creatures so that they can be protected.

This project is inspired by the work of The Shuttleworth Foundation, which has tracked the movement of turtles based at the islands of Príncipe and Poilão off the west coast of Africa. Each year turtles return to their nesting grounds and spend time mating and laying eggs. But where exactly do they go while they are there? The Shuttleworth Foundation has developed inexpensive electronic tags that can be safely attached to real sea turtles to track their movement. 

Turtle tags provide coordinate numbers that show where a turtle has been. It's much easier for people to understand this data if it is drawn on a map.

### What you will make

Click on the green flag and then click on each turtle to see the locations it visited over a few days. You can also click on the 'grid/map button' in the top left corner to switch between a Scratch coordinates grid and a map of Poilão island.

The later steps of this project ask learners to download files that are then imported into Scratch. We recommend that you try this out first, and use the same devices and network as the learners, so that you can tell them exactly what to do. You can download and import files to Scratch on a desktop or mobile device. It is straightforward, but the exact details vary depending on the device, browser, and operating system version. 

If you are using iPads, then iOS 13 supports local file storage to a Downloads directory. If you are using an older version of iOS, then you will need a suitable storage location, such as a cloud drive.
