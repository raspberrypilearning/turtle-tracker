## Draw the route

In this step, you will use the Pen{:class="block3extensions"} extension to draw a path to show the turtleâ€™s movement, and will then add stamps to represent its known locations. 

When a tag is placed on a turtle, it uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to detect its current position from a satellite. This data is stored and can be used to work out the route taken by the turtle. 

The `Pen`{:class="block3extensions"} extension has already been added to the starter project.

Select the **Turtle 1** sprite and add code to set up the pen:

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
+erase all
+set pen [color v] to (40)
+set pen [brightness v] to (50)
+set pen size to (2)
+pen up
glide (1) secs to x: (-220) y: (-160)
```

The colour `40` matches the colour of the sprite's costume.

Add code to draw the route taken by the turtle using the pen:

```blocks3
when this sprite clicked
+pen up
glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (100)
+pen down
glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (-100)
glide (1) secs to x: (-100) y: (-100)
glide (1) secs to x: (-100) y: (100)
glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (100)
```

Click the green flag to run the setup code, and then click on the **Turtle 1** on the Stage to see it draw its path.

If your turtle doesn't draw a square, then carefully check the coordinates you entered in the previous step.

Now add a stamp of the turtle to show the known positions of the turtle.

glide (1) secs to x: (100) y: (-100)

Click the green flag and then click on the **Turtle 1** sprite to see the turtle draw its route and stamp a marker at each known position.

Of course, turtles don't swim in perfect squares! Try change the coordinate numbers to get your turtle to swim in a different route.
